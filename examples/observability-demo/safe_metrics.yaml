# OpenFilter Safe Metrics Allowlist
# This file defines which metrics are allowed to be exported to OpenLineage
# Only metrics listed here will be included in heartbeat facets

# OpenLineage Configuration (optional)
# openlineage:
#   url: "https://oleander.dev"
#   api_key: "your_api_key_here"
#   heartbeat_interval: 10

safe_metrics:
  # Frame processing metrics
  - frames_processed
  - frames_with_detections
  
  # Detection histograms (base names - bridge will add _histogram suffix)
  - detections_per_frame
  - detection_confidence
  - processing_time_ms
  
  # Object analysis metrics
  - object_size_ratio
  
  # System metrics (wildcards supported)
  - customprocessor_*
  - customvisualizer_*
  
  # Additional metrics for testing
  - "*_fps"
  - "*_cpu"
  - "*_mem"

# Alternative configuration examples:
# 
# Minimal allowlist (only basic counters):
# safe_metrics:
#   - frames_processed
#   - frames_with_detections
#
# Wildcard examples:
# safe_metrics:
#   - frames_*          # All frame-related metrics
#   - "*_histogram"     # All histogram metrics
#   - "detection_*"     # All detection metrics
#
# Security-focused (no histograms):
# safe_metrics:
#   - frames_processed
#   - frames_with_detections
#   - customprocessor_fps
#   - customprocessor_cpu
