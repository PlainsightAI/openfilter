# Restrictive Safe Metrics Allowlist
# This file demonstrates a minimal allowlist for testing security controls
# Only basic frame counters are allowed - no histograms or system metrics

safe_metrics:
  # Only basic counters allowed
  - frames_processed
  - frames_with_detections
  
  # No histograms allowed (commented out to test blocking)
  # - detections_per_frame_histogram
  # - detection_confidence_histogram
  # - processing_time_ms_histogram
  # - object_size_ratio_histogram
  
  # No system metrics allowed (commented out to test blocking)
  # - customprocessor_fps
  # - customprocessor_cpu
  # - customprocessor_mem
  # - customvisualizer_fps
  
  # Test that these specific metrics are blocked:
  # - Any histogram ending in "_histogram"
  # - Any system metric with filter prefixes
  # - Any wildcard patterns
